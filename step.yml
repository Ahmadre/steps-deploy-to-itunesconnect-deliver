  Deploy to iTunes Connect, using the
  fantastic [Deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver)
  Ruby gem.

  **If this is the very first build** of the app
  you try to deploy to iTunes Connect then you might want to upload the first
  build manually to make sure it fulfills the initial iTunes Connect submission
  verification process.

  ## Setup guide and notes

  * Register an app on iTunes Connect, on the **My Apps** page. Click on the *plus sign* and select the **New iOS App** option. This requires an **admin** account.
  * Requires an **App Store iOS distibution Provisioning Profile**
  * The app's Xcode project have to contain an *entitlements* file for the Target
  * Every build which you want to push to iTunes Connect have to have a **unique build and version number** pair (*increment either or both before a new deploy to iTunes Connect*)

  ## Example entitlements file

  The entitlements file is usually located in the *target's folder*,
  with the name *YOUR-TARGET-NAME.entitlements*.
  It also have to be set in Xcode project settings:
  in `Target > Build Settings` set the key **Code Signing Entitlements** (`CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`)
  to the file's path (*relative to the Xcode project file*).
  It's content have to
  be something like this (both the `application-identifier` and the `beta-reports-active` are required):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
      <plist version="1.0">
      <dict>
        <key>application-identifier</key>
        <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)$(CFBundleIdentifier)</string>
        <key>beta-reports-active</key>
        <true/>
      </dict>
      </plist>

      Wait for the submission to be processed and then
      enable **TestFlight Beta Testing** for this specific version?

      If this option is disabled then this step won't wait
      for the new version to be processed on iTunes Connect
      and won't enable it for *TestFlight Beta Testing* automatically.

      *Enabling this option will wait for the submission to be
      processed which might take a couple of minutes after the
      new version is deployed to iTunes Connect*.

      **NOTE:** if this option is enabled then this step will
      fail if it can't enable TestFlight Beta Testing for the
      version, even if the version was successfully uploaded
      to iTunes Connect and only the TestFlight Beta Testing
      submission failed.
